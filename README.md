- 👋 Hi, I’m @nkondakoff
- 👀 I’m interested in architecture, design, cinema, storytelling - and I believe programming will help me better understand all of that.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full Stack Web Development, AutoCAD Revit, Rhino 8 with Grasshopper, and better time management.
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate on projects at the moment, but stay tuned, as this is bound to change once I get my grips around the fundamentals.
- 📫 How to reach me? You can try emailing me at atanas.g.kondakov@gmail.com, or finding me on most social media as @nkondakoff or @nak.kondakoff. :D
